simple web scraper which downloads a lots of wallpapers from 'wallpaperaccess.com' for you and sort them according to their resolution
first if you want to download the wallpapers you should use 'wallpaper_downloader.py'
it will first ask you for the title, which is a phrase or a word that you can find on the url of the page that you want to download its wallpapers:

then it starts downloading all the wallpapers and put them in a specific directory(C:\Users\{Username}\Desktop\wallpapers\{title})

some of the wallpapers are good for mobile phones and some of them good for PCs, but you can automatically sort them with the 'wallpaper_sorter.py' file(wallpapers should be in a specific directory:"C:\Users\{Username}\Desktop\wallpapers\{title}")
